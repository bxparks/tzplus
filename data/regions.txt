# Manually maintained list of continents and oceans which are the highest level
# of organization of timezones. The hierarchical structure is:
# {region}/{country}/{timezone}.
#
# The primary reason that this file was created was to split the single
# "America" region used by the TZDB timezone into three regions: North America,
# Central Amerca, and South America. Central America is actually a part of
# North America, but adding this region solves the problem where it was
# difficult to classify a few Caribbean islands (eg. Aruba, Bonaire, Carucao,
# Trindad & Tobago) because they are geographically on the continental shelf of
# South America, but are culturally more North America due to their history.
